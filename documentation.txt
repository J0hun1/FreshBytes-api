Django setup:
    django-admin startproject <project-name>

    if in any case it fails try:
        python -m django startproject <name>


to create new django app within directory:
    python manage.py startapp <name>
        1. then add the "<name>" into the settings .py in <project-name> directory
        2. also add DRF with "rest_framework"


notes:
    apps - ways to separate different logics (the api directory in this project's case)
    models - where we define different db models (models.py)
    serializers - takes models and converts it into json compatible data (serializers.py)
    view - utilizes model and serializers
    object relational mapping - maps a python object to a database instance
    generics - contains generic views used to update/delete etc. any model
    urls - defining a root or url to access the view
